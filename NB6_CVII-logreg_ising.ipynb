    "## Learning Goal\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to show how one can employ Logistic Regression to classify the states of the 2D Ising model according to their phase. We will discuss overfitting, regularization, and learn how to use the scikit-learn library. We will also examine the role of the optimizer in making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy function of the classical Ising model is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H = -J\\sum_{\\langle ij\\rangle}S_{i}S_j,\\qquad \\qquad S_j\\in\\{\\pm 1\\} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the lattice site indices $i,j$ run over all nearest neighbors of a 2D square lattice, and $J$ is some arbitrary interaction energy scale. We adopt periodic boundary conditions. Onsager proved that this model undergoes a thermal phase transition in the thermodynamic limit from an ordered ferromagnet with all spins aligned to a disordered phase at the critical temperature $T_c/J=2/\\log(1+\\sqrt{2})\\approx 2.26$. For any finite system size, this critical point is expanded to a critical region around $T_c$.\n",
    "\n"

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "An interesting question to ask is whether one can train a statistical model to distinguish between the two phases of the Ising model. If successful, this can be used to locate the position of the critical point in more complicated models where an exact analytical solution has so far remained elusive. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, given an Ising state, we would like to classify whether it belongs to the ordered or the disordered phase, without any additional information other than the spin configuration itself. This categorical machine learning problem is well suited for logistic regression. Notice that, for the purposes of applying logistic regression, the 2D spin state of the Ising model will be flattened out to a 1D array, so it will not be easy to learn information about the structure of the contiguous ordered 2D domains [see figure below]. Such information can be incorporated using other methods such as multi-layer deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), see Secs. IX, X and XI of the review and the corresponding notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The 2D Ising Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, we consider the 2D Ising model on a $40\\times 40$ square lattice, and use Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling to prepare $10^4$ states at every fixed temperature $T$ out of a pre-defined set $T\\in[0.25,0.5,\\cdots,4.0]$. Using Onsager's criterion, we can assign a label to each state according to its phase: $0$ if the state is disordered, and $1$ if it is ordered. Our goal is to predict the phase of a sample given the spin configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is well-known that, near the critical temperature $T_c$, the ferromagnetic correlation length diverges which, among other things, leads to a critical slowing down of the MC algorithm. Therefore, we expect identifying the phases to be harder in the critical region. With this in mind, consider the following three types of states: ordered ($T/J<2.0$), critical ($2.0\\leq T/J\\leq 2.5)$ and disordered ($T/J>2.5$). We use both ordered and disordered states to train the logistic regressor and once the supervised training procedure is complete, we evaluate the performance of our classification model on unseen ordered, disordered and critical states.

As we already mentioned, minimizing it requires the use of numerical toolboxes.

IV of the review for more details].\n",

Indeed, we did not discuss the role of the regularisor explicitly in the context of Logistic Regression extensively, yet this concept is crucial in order to prevent overfitting, and we encourage the interested reader to play with the different regularization types and regularization strengths and compare model performances. \n",

    "## Interpreting the results\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we can read off the figure above is the relative degree of overfitting. This information is contained in the difference in accuracy of our model on the training (blue) and test (red) datasets. Notice that the accuracy difference between test and training sets is significant but not unreasonable, within $10\\%$. Interestingly, which optimizer performs better depends on the value of the regularization strength. Moreover, similar to the Linear Regression examples, we find that there exists a sweet spot for the regularization strength $\\lambda$ that results in optimal performance of the logistic regressor, at about $\\lambda\\sim 10^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the physics of the Ising model close to criticality, we expect that predicting the phase of a sample will become much more difficult close to the critical point. We can visually see this by looking at the states in the critical region, (see Fig. above and plot other examples). Notice that it is no longer easy even for a trained human eye to distinguish between the ferromagnetic and the disordered phases close to $T_c$. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is an interesting exercise to compare the training and test accuracies in the ordered and disordered phases to the accuracy of the model near the critical point (i.e. critical states). Recall that the model is not trained on critical states. Notice that the accuracy is about $10\\%$ smaller for the critical states (green curves). \n"
